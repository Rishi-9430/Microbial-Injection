# Microbial Injection for Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR)

##  Overview
This project explores the use of **microbial injection techniques** to enhance oil recovery from reservoirs through **Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR)** methods.  
The study focuses on culturing **methanogenic bacteria**, injecting them into a **laboratory reservoir model**, and analyzing their effect on **oil displacement efficiency**.  
Additionally, a **case study of the Shangli Oilfield (China)** was examined to understand real-world MEOR applications and field-scale performance.
